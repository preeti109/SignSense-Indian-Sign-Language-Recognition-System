# SignSense-Indian Sign Language Recognition System

SignSense is a machine learning-based system designed to recognize gestures in Indian Sign Language (ISL). This project aims to analyze and identify various alphabets and numbers using a robust dataset of hand gesture images, helping bridge the communication gap for individuals with speech and hearing impairments.

Introduction to Sign Languages
Sign Languages are a group of languages that use predefined actions and movements to convey messages. These languages are primarily developed to aid deaf and verbally challenged individuals. Sign languages rely on a precise and simultaneous combination of:

Hand movements.
Hand orientation.
Hand shapes.
Different regions have developed distinct sign languages, such as American Sign Language (ASL) and Indian Sign Language (ISL). In this project, we focus on Indian Sign Language, a prevalent sign language in South Asian countries.
